2.  Description

        When given an Unix Timestam as an integer between 0 and 			253402300799 the app wil convert this timestamp in the corresponding date and time.
        The count starts at the Unix Epoch on January 1st, 1970 at UTC (Co√∂rdnated Universal Time).
        The unix timestap is merely the number of seconds between a particular date (in the past of in the futur) and the Unix Epoch.

        The app is build as an exercice on everthing I learned so far in my course 'Frontend developer' at Syntra-AB.
